## What is Data engineering ?

Data engineering is the discipline of collecting, storing, preparing, managing, and providing the data necessary for data analysis, Data Science and decision-making. It is the technical aspect of data management, and it includes activities such as:

- Data collection: Gathering data from various sources, such as databases, APIs, files, sensors, etc.

- Data storage: Storing data in a secure and efficient manner, using data storage systems such as databases, data lakes, data warehouses, etc.

- Data preparation: Cleaning, normalizing, and transforming data to make it usable for data analysis.

- Data provisioning: Making data available to end-users in an efficient manner, using tools such as APIs, dashboards, etc.

- Monitoring and maintenance: Monitoring data and systems for errors and anomalies, and maintaining data storage systems in optimal working condition.


So in datamind you will learn the technical skills required for data engineering include knowledge of databases, data storage systems, programming tools, and information technology.
